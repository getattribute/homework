Attribute homework problems
========================

Each directory in the [Attribute Homework GitHub repository](https://github.com/getattribute/homework) contains a different homework problem, seven in total. Please complete one problem to start off, we will ask for more if needed. Make sure to read the README in each directory, it will give you important information on completing each problem.

This is an open-book test, so Google away, but please don't copy your work from pre-existing solutions you may find or ask
others to help you complete the exercises. Solutions should be able to be run on a UNIX command line (Linux/Mac). We're quite familiar with Go, Ruby, Javascript, and Python, but if your submission is in some other language (which is OK), please let us know how we can set up our environment to run your code.

A quick tip
-----------

We want to see how you approach the problem, understand what's being asked, and solve it. This is the first stage in our hiring process, so please don't feel pressure to demonstrate every skill you have.

- **DO** submit the homework as if you were giving it to a coworker for code review.
- **DO** aim for a clear and concise MVP for your solution.
- **DO** follow directions and solve just the problem in front of you. There's no need to over-engineer the solution.

- **DON'T** submit multiple solutions. Choose the approach and language you feel is best.
- **DON'T** include unit tests. We won't run them.
- **DON'T** worry about handling arbitrary input, unless the assignment explicitly requires input validation.

Good luck! We look forward to reviewing your submission.
